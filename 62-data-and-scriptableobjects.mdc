# Data & ScriptableObject Rules

## Purpose
Keeps static configuration/data clean and prevents mixing data, logic, and runtime state.

## ScriptableObjects
- ScriptableObjects are for:
  - Static configuration (items, upgrades, recipes, prices, spawn tables)
  - Authoring content
- ScriptableObjects are NOT for:
  - Runtime mutable state
  - Service logic
  - Cross-system orchestration

## Data vs Logic vs State (Hard Rule)
- Data: ScriptableObjects / JSON tables / configs
- Logic: Domain + Application code
- State: R3 reactive state in Application/State
These must not be mixed.

## Access Pattern
- Configs are injected via DI:
  - RegisterInstance(config) in VContainer
- Avoid deep SO reference graphs that act like hidden service locators.
  - Keep references shallow and explicit.

## Validation
- Add validation utilities (editor-time or runtime) that verify:
  - required IDs exist
  - values are within expected ranges
- Validation must not introduce gameplay rules into SOs.

## IDs and Lookups
- Prefer stable identifiers (string or int IDs) for content references.
- Avoid using Unity instance IDs as persistent identifiers.

## Forbidden
- ScriptableObject holding ReactiveProperty / subscriptions.
- ScriptableObject calling MessagePipe or UseCases.
