name: Folder & Feature Organization
description: Use this rule when creating new folders, scripts, prefabs, ScriptableObjects, or UI. Defines where files live, how features are grouped, and how Unity-specific assets align with architecture.
---

# Folder & Feature Organization

## Goals
- One obvious place for every file.
- Feature-based grouping without breaking architectural boundaries.
- Minimize cross-folder dependencies and circular references.
- Make refactors predictable and safe.

---

## Top-Level Folder Policy

Assets/
├── Game/ # All game-specific code & assets
│ ├── Domain/
│ ├── Application/
│ ├── Presentation/
│ ├── Infrastructure/
│ ├── Features/
│ └── Shared/
│
├── Art/ # Raw art assets (models, textures, audio)
├── UI/ # Shared UI prefabs, themes, fonts
├── Scenes/
├── Settings/
└── ThirdParty/  
### Rules
- **Nothing game-related lives outside `Assets/Game`.**
- `ThirdParty` contains imported packages only (no custom code).
- `Art` contains raw assets only — no gameplay logic.

---

## Architectural Folders

### `Game/Domain`
**Pure logic**
- No UnityEngine references.
- No MonoBehaviours.
- No ScriptableObject inheritance.
- Contains:
  - entities
  - value objects
  - rules
  - domain events (data-only)

### `Game/Application`
**Use-cases & orchestration**
- No scene references.
- No GameObject logic.
- Coordinates Domain + Infrastructure.
- Contains:
  - services
  - commands/queries
  - loaders/savers
  - factories (logical, not prefab)

### `Game/Infrastructure`
**IO & external systems**
- Unity APIs
- save/load
- time
- random
- input
- platform services
- file system

### `Game/Presentation`
**Unity-facing layer**
- MonoBehaviours
- Presenters/ViewModels
- UI binding logic
- No business rules.

---

## Feature-Based Organization

### `Game/Features`
Features group related code **horizontally**, but must still respect layers.

Features/
├── Restaurant/
│ ├── Domain/
│ ├── Application/
│ ├── Presentation/
│ └── Infrastructure/
│
├── Workers/
│ ├── Domain/
│ ├── Application/
│ └── Presentation/ 
### Rules
- Feature folders **mirror architectural layers**.
- Features may depend on:
  - Shared
  - Domain/Application of other features (carefully)
- Features must not bypass layers (e.g., Presentation → Domain direct mutation).

---

## Shared Folder

### `Game/Shared`
Used only when duplication is worse than coupling.

Allowed:
- base interfaces
- shared utilities
- cross-feature value objects
- cross-feature events

Rules:
- No feature-specific logic here.
- No Unity scene knowledge.

---

## Unity Asset Placement Rules

### Scenes
Assets/Scenes/ ├── Boot/ ├── Gameplay/ ├── UI/



- Each scene must have exactly one Bootstrapper.
- Scene-specific scripts live with the feature or Presentation layer, not inside `Scenes`.

### ScriptableObjects
Assets/Game/.../Data/



Rules:
- ScriptableObjects live near the system that consumes them.
- Never create a global `ScriptableObjects` dump folder.

### Prefabs
Assets/UI/Prefabs/
Assets/Game/.../Presentation/Prefabs/ 
Rules:
- UI prefabs separated from gameplay prefabs.
- Prefabs never contain business logic.

---

## Naming Conventions

- Folders: `PascalCase`
- Scripts: `PascalCase`
- Features: singular nouns (`Worker`, not `Workers`, unless it's a system)
- Avoid generic names: `Utils`, `Helpers`, `Misc`

---

## Forbidden Patterns

🚫 Feature code directly inside `Scenes/`  
🚫 Logic inside `Art/` or `UI/`  
🚫 Cross-feature access via `FindObjectOfType`  
🚫 Mega folders like `Scripts/EverythingHere`

---

## Decision Guide (Quick)

| You are creating... | Put it in |
|---------------------|----------|
| Business rule | Domain |
| Use-case | Application |
| MonoBehaviour | Presentation |
| Save/Load | Infrastructure |
| Feature-specific logic | Features/FeatureName |
| Shared contract | Shared |

## Checklist
- [ ] Can I explain why this file lives here?
- [ ] Does it respect layer boundaries?
- [ ] Is there exactly one obvious alternative? (If yes, you chose wrong.)
