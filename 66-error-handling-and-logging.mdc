description: Defines error handling strategies, Result-based flows, and logging standards. Use this rule when implementing IO, async flows, or user-impacting operations.

# Error Handling & Logging Rules

## Purpose
Standardizes errors, results, and logs so bugs are visible and recoverable.

## No Silent Failures (Hard Rule)
- `catch { }` is forbidden.
- Swallowing exceptions is forbidden.

## Result-First for User Flows
For flows like:
- Save/Load
- Purchases/unlocks
- Addressables load
- Network calls (if any)
Prefer returning a Result type:
- Success/Failure
- Error code/reason (human-readable + machine-readable)

Exceptions are still allowed for truly unexpected states, but must be logged.

## Log Levels Standard
- Info: important milestones (scene loaded, save completed)
- Warning: recoverable abnormal cases (migrated save, optional asset missing)
- Error: player-impacting failure (save failed)
- Exception: unexpected failure requiring stack trace

## Ownership
- Presentation: minimal logs (mostly none)
- Application: flow/milestone logs
- Infrastructure: detailed IO/Addressables logs (but rate-limited)

## Async Error Safety
- Avoid fire-and-forget.
- If necessary:
  - use a central helper that logs exceptions
  - never allow async exceptions to vanish

## User Feedback
- Player-facing errors must be converted to UI messages via Application layer
  (UI should not interpret exceptions directly).

## Forbidden
- Logging spam in loops / per-frame.
- Returning null as an error signal (use Result).
