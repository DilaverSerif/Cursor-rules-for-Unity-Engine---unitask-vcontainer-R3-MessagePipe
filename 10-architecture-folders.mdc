# Architecture & Folder Rules

## Folder Ownership
- Domain: Pure C#, no UnityEngine, no R3, no MessagePipe
- Application: UseCases, Services, State (R3 lives here)
- Presentation: UI, MonoBehaviours, ViewModels
- Infrastructure: Save, Time, Addressables, adapters
- Bootstrap: LifetimeScopes, Installers, EntryPoints

## Dependencies
- Domain -> nothing
- Application -> Domain
- Infrastructure -> Domain (+ Application contracts)
- Presentation -> Application (+ Domain read-only)

## Anti-patterns
- Domain using Unity API — forbidden
- Static singletons — forbidden
- Cross-layer circular references — forbidden
