# UniTask Async Rules

## General
- Prefer UniTask over coroutines.
- Avoid async void (except Unity callbacks).

## Cancellation
- Every long async flow must support CancellationToken.

## Exceptions
- Never swallow exceptions.
- Log or propagate.

## Anti-patterns
- Task.Run for gameplay — forbidden
- Coroutines for business logic — forbidden
