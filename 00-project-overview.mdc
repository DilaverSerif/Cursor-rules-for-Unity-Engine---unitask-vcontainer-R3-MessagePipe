# Project Overview (Unity) — VContainer + UniTask + R3

## Goals
- Maintainable, testable architecture for a Unity game using:
  - VContainer for DI
  - UniTask for async workflows
  - R3 for reactive state + UI binding
  - MessagePipe for event-driven communication

## Non-goals
- Do NOT introduce additional frameworks unless explicitly requested.
- Do NOT use static singletons for services/state.

## High-level Principles
- Domain: pure C# rules/models (no Unity API)
- Application: use-cases, orchestration, state coordination
- Presentation: MonoBehaviours/UI, user input, view binding
- Infrastructure: IO, Addressables, persistence, platform adapters

## AI Behavior Rules (Cursor)
- Always respect layer boundaries.
- Prefer minimal, safe changes.
- When unsure: choose simpler, safer architecture.
